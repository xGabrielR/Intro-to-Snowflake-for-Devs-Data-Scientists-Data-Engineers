**Data Engineering with Snowflake**

- In Snowflake, exists four steps in Data Engineering: Ingestion, Transformation, Orchestration and Observability.
- Ingestion: Streaming (Kafka) with Snowpipe (Incremental), Batch with COPY, Native connection (SaaS Database), In-place data sharing across regions.
- Transformation: SQL, Snowpark Dataframe, Store Procedures, Dynamic Tables with incremental reference, UDF and TUDFs.
- Orchestration: Open-source tools, Streams and Tasks (Serverless tasks).
- Observability: Alerts & Notifications, Logs & event tables and Visual DAGS.
